# Rutgers Flutter Mock

This repository contains my Flutter mockup of the cross-platform Rutgers app rewrite.

The basic design of the UI is expected to be finalized by September 2019.

At that point, work in this repo will end, and the focus will shift to creating minimal apps in Flutter and React Native adhering to the chosen design.
